The Census Bureau said: 

-- Some 17.2% of all money income received by families in 1988 went to the wealthiest 5% of all families, up from 16.9% in 1987.
That is the greatest share reported for any year since 1950, although changing definitions over the years distort the comparison. 

-- The top fifth of all families got 44% of the income, up from 41.5% a decade earlier.
The bottom fifth of all families got 4.6% of the income, down from 5.2% a decade earlier. 

-- Confirming other government data showing that wages aren't keeping pace with inflation, earnings of year-round, full-time male workers fell 1.3% in 1988 after adjusting for higher prices, the first such drop since 1982.
Earnings of female workers were unchanged. 

-- Women working full-time earned 66 cents for every dollar earned by men, a penny more than in 1987 and seven cents more than in 1978. 

-- Median household income -- which includes both those living in families and those who aren't -- rose 0.3% last year to $27,225 after inflation.
It rose sharply in the Northeast and Midwest and fell slightly in the South and West.
Median family income was $32,191, down 0.2%. 

-- Per capita income of blacks, though still only 60% that of whites, rose 3.9% in 1988, while per capita income of whites rose only 1.5%. 

-- Among married couples, the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply, as income of black families shot up 6.8% while income of whites didn't budge
