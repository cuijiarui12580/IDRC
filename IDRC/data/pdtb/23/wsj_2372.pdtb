The revenue-raising provisions, which affect mostly corporations, would: 

-- Prevent companies that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy-outs, effective Aug. 2, 1989. 

-- Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received, effective the day after the tax bill is enacted. 

-- Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans, effective June 6, 1989, that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers.
The measure repeals a 50% exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP, if the ESOP owns less than 30% of the employer's stock. 

-- Curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities, such as zero-coupon bonds, that postpone cash interest payments. 

-- Raise $851 million by suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes. 

-- Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies, effective August 1990. 

-- Impose a tax on ozone-depleting chemicals, such as those used in air conditioners and in Styrofoam, beginning at $1.10 a pound starting next year. 

-- Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding. 

-- Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly, effective next year. 

-- Restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash. 

-- Increase to $6 a person from $3 the international air-passenger departure tax, and impose a $3-a-person tax on international departures by commercial ships
