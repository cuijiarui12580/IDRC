Robert Guy, an associate curator at the Princeton Art Museum, was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix, which he, as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in "IFAR Reports," knew was stolen.
The timing of his visit was fortuitous; the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall.
To confirm Mr. Guy's identification, Sotheby's and IFAR exchanged photos by fax, and the waiting man, apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen, agreed to release it.
The cup had been insured, and in short order it was given over to a Chubb & Son representative.
The original owners happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home
