Nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ($352 million) borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks, led by Industrial Bank of Japan, were pressuring the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand's civil-service pension fund.
Unwilling to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid, most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing, forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week
