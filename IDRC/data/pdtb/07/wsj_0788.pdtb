The most arbitrary of these is the imposition of "service fees," which will directly widen the cost spread between U.S. and foreign markets. 

Other provisions have a more subtle, but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of U.S. exchanges.
These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages. 

In addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members, these measures could have other, far-reaching repercussions. 

One section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct.
Nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances. 

It is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation.
In an already low-profitmargin business, commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public, depriving the private individual of access to the markets. 

Another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them.
This untried concept would expose these firms to potentially astronomical punitive damages. 

Faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade, many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers.
This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers.
A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity. 

Finally, under the bill, a number of legitimate, longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned, unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue.
In other words, regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance, rather than through a normal deliberative procedure. 

The affected practices include the placing of oral orders, which is the way most public customer orders are placed, and trading between affiliated brokers, even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client.
Also precluded would be dual trading, whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account, a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets
